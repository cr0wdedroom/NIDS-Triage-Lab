# NIDS-Triage-Lab

A lab demonstrating Network Security Monitoring, this has 4 phases that are -

Phase 1: Environment Setup and Network Preparation
Ensured Kali VM is correctly configured to see all network traffic and it is on same network interface with Windows VM.

Phase 2: NIDS Configuration (Snort Setup)
Configured Snort using confirmed IPs and added the custom detection logic.

Phase 3: Threat Simulation & Alerting
Triggered Alerts using custom rules and saved them in a log file on Kali VM.

Phase 4: Packet Analysis & Triage 
Used Wireshark to perform PCAP (Packet Analysis) on raw network traffic to confirm the Snort alerts are True Positives.
